<h1> If I leave here tomorrow <br>
Would you still remember me? <br>
For I must be traveling on now <br>
'Cause there's too many places I've got to see <br>
But if I stay here with you, girl <br>
Things just couldn't be the same <br>
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now <br>
And this bird you cannot change <br>
Oh, oh, oh, oh <br>
And the bird you cannot change <br>
And this bird, you cannot change <br>
Lord knows, I can't change <br>
Bye-bye baby, it's been sweet love, yeah, yeah <br>
Though this feelin' I can't change <br>
But please don't take it so badly <br>
'Cause Lord knows, I'm to blame <br>
But if I stay here with you, girl <br>
Things just couldn't be the same <br>
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now <br>
And this bird you cannot change <br>
Oh, oh, oh, oh <br>
And the bird you cannot change <br>
And this bird, you cannot change <br>
Lord knows, I can't change <br>
Lord help me, I can't change <br>
Lord, I can't change <br>
Won't you fly high, free bird, yeah!</h1>
